\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}

We will denote by $|a-b|_X$ the distance between points $a$ and $b$ in the metric space $X$.

Let $(a_1,\dots a_n)$ be a point array in a metric space $X$ and $T$ be a 
tree with the vertexes labeled by $\{a_1,\dots,a_n\}$.
We say that $(a_1,\dots a_n)$  satisfies the \emph{tree comparison} for $T$ if there is a point array $(\~a_1,\dots, \~a_n)$ in the Hilbert space $\HH$ such that 
\[|\~a_i-\~a_j|_\HH\ge|a_i-a_j|_X\]
for any $i$ and $j$ and the equality holds if $a_i$ and $a_j$ are adjacent in $T$.

Fix a tree $T$ with $n$ vertexes as above.
We say that a metric space $X$ satisfies the tree comparison for $T$ if 
every $n$-points arrays in $X$ satisfies the tree comparison for $T$.
We say that  $X$ satisfies \emph{all tree comparisons}
if $X$ satisfies the tree comparison for all trees.

\parbf{Notation for trees.}
To encode the labeled tree as on the diagram, we will use notation $p/xy(q/vw)$.
It means that we choose $p$ as the root; 
$p$ has two children leafs to $x$, $y$ and one child $q$ with two children leafs $v$ and $w$.
Taking another root for the same tree, we may get different encodings, for eaxample $q/vw(p/xy)$ or $x/(p/y(q/vw))$.

If we do not need the labeling of vertexes,
it is sufficient to write the number of leafs in the brackets;
this way we can write 2(2) instead of $p/xy(q/vw)$ meaning that the root has two leafs $x$ and $y$ and its other child $q$ has two leafs $v$ and $w$.  
The same tree can be written as (1(2)) meaning that the root $x$ has no leafs, $p$ has one leaf $y$ and one child $q$ with two leafs $v$ and $w$.

Using the described notation, we could say that a metric space \emph{satisfies the comparison for the tree 2(2)}, or briefly  \emph{2(2)-tree comparison},  meaning that it satisfies the tree comparison on the diagram.
We could also say \emph{by $p/xy(q/vw)$-comparison we have...} meaning that we apply the comparison for these 6 points and the tree on the diagram.

\parbf{Alexandrov spaces.}
We define \emph{Alexandrov space} as complete length space with curvature bounded below in the sense of Alexandrov;
the latter is equivalent to the 3-tree comparison for the tripod-tree on the diagram. 

Using the introduced notation, \cite[4.1]{AKP} can be restated the following way: \emph{If length-metric space satisfies $3$-tree comparison, then it also satisfies $n$-tree comparison for every positive integer~$n$.}

In this example the trees are \emph{monopolar};
that is they have one vertex (\emph{pole}) adjacent to all other vertexes.

\parbf{Dipolar comparison.} 
A tree will be called \emph{dipoar} if it has exactly two poles;
that is, two vertexes of degree at least two.
Equivalently, they could be defined as the trees with diameter 3.
These are $m(n)$-trees for positive integers $m$ and $n$; in this tree 
$m$ vertexes are adjacent to the first pole, $n$ vertexes are adjacent to the second pole and the tw poles are adjacent.

In Section~\ref{6-dipole} we will show that the comparison for the any Alexandrov space with nonnegative curvature satisfies the comparisons for the trees 2(2) and 3(1) --- the first two trees an the following diagram.

In Section~\ref{7-dipole}, we will show that the comparison for the tree 4(1) (the third on the diagram) implies
the curvature condition introduced by Ma--Trudinger--Wang (briefly MTW condition) and convexity of tangent injectivity loci (briefly CTIL condition).
These two conditions appear in the study of contunuity of optimal transport betweens regular measures with positive continuous density functions.
The continuity implies both MTW and CTIL conditions and slightly stronger version of these two conditions imply the continuity;
see \cite{FRV-Nec+Suf}, \cite{MTW+CTIL} and the references there in.

Note that dipolar comparison provides a uniform way to treat combined CTIL+MTW condition;
this partially answers the question of CÃ©dric Villani in ???.

\parbf{All tree comparisons.}
In Section~\ref{sec:all-tree} we show that if the space satisfies all tree comparisons then it is a target space of submetry from a subset in Hilbert space.

We also show that all bi-quotients of compact Lie groups with bi-invariant metrics satisfy all tree comparison.
