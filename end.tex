\section{Final remarks}

The following problem discussed in \cite[7.1]{AKP} was one of the original motivations to study the tree comparison.

\begin{thm}{Problem}
Which finite metric spaces admit isometric embeddings into Alexandrov spaces with curvature $\ge \kappa$.
\end{thm}

The problem is still open.
According to \cite[4.1]{AKP}, the $n$-tree comparison provides a necessary condition for the problem.
This condition is sufficient for the 4-point metric spaces and possibly for 5-point metric spaces, but not sufficient for 6-point metric spaces.
The corresponding example of 6-point metric space was constructed by Sergei Ivanov, see \cite{AKP}.

Theorem~\ref{2(2)+3(1)}, provides a source for such examples --- it is sufficient to construct construct 6-pint metric space which satisfy all 5-tree comparisons, but does not satisfy 2(2)-tree comparison.
This class of examples includes the example of Sergei Ivanov;
it does not satisfies the comparison for $y/az(q/xb)$ in the notations of \cite[7.1]{AKP}.

We expect that the 5-tree and 2(2)-tree comparisons (see the trees on the diagram) are sufficient for 6-point metric spaces.
