\section{Final remarks}

The following problem discussed in \cite[7.1]{AKP} was one of the original motivations to study the tree comparison.

\begin{thm}{Problem}
Which finite metric spaces admit isometric embeddings into Alexandrov spaces with nonnegative curvature.
\end{thm}

The problem is still open.
According to \cite[4.1]{AKP}, the $(n-1)$-tree comparison provides a necessary condition for the problem $n$-point metric spaces.
This condition is sufficient for the 4-point metric spaces.
It might be still sufficient for 5-point metric spaces,
but not for 6-point metric spaces.

The corresponding example of 6-point metric space was constructed by Sergei Ivanov, see \cite{AKP}.
Theorem~\ref{2(2)+3(1)}, provides a source for such examples --- any 6-point metric space which satisfy all 5-tree comparisons, but does not satisfy 2(2)-tree comparison provide an example.
This class of examples includes the example of Sergei Ivanov --- in the notations of \cite[7.1]{AKP} it does not satisfies the comparison for the tree $y/az(q/xb)$.

We expect that the 5-tree and 2(2)-tree comparisons (these are the comparisons for the trees on the diagram) are sufficient for 6-point metric spaces.

Here an other candidate for a sufficient condition.

\begin{thm}{Question}
Assume $F$ is a finite metric space which satisfies all tree comparisons.
Is it true that $F$ is isometric to a subset of Alexandrov space with nonpositive curvature?
\end{thm}

Note that even for finite metric space the all tree comparison has to be checked for infinite set of trees since one point of the space may be used as a label for several vertexes in the tree.

There is a chance that for 5-point and 6-point metric spaces, this condition is also necessary. 
Since there nonnegatively curved Riemannian riemannian manifolds which are not cost-convex, 
Theorem~\ref{T=>CTIL:CTIL} implies that this condition can not be necessary for 7-point metric spaces.

For any metric space $X$ with an isometric group action $G\acts X$ with closed orbits the quotient map $X\to X/G$ is a submetry.
In particular, by Theorem~\ref{thm:hilbert-quotient}, if $G\acts \HH$ is an isometric action with closed orbits on the Hilbert space, then the quotient space $\HH/G$ satisfies all tree comparisons.

\begin{thm}{Question}
Assume $X$ is a metric space satisfying all tree comparisons.
Is it always possible to construct an isometric group action with closed orbits on the Hilbert space $G\acts \HH$ such that $X$ is isometric to a subset in $\HH/G$?
\end{thm}

Assume $M$ is nonnegatively curved Riemannian manifold
and $G\acts M$ is an isometric action with closed orbits.
Then the quotient space $A=M/G$ is an Alexandrov space.
It is easy to see that all singular points of $A$ form an extremal set.

\begin{thm}{Question}
Is it true that the same holds for all Alexandrov spaces which satisfy 4(1)-tree  comparison (or all dipolar tree comparisons)?

In particular, is it true that the space of directions at any isolated singularity in such Alexandrov space has diameter at most $\tfrac\pi2$?
\end{thm}

If instead of the Hilbert space $\HH$ we use infinite dimensional sphere or infinite dimensional hyperbolic space we will arrive to spherical and hyperbolic tree comparisons.
Theorem~\ref{2(2)+3(1)} admits a straightforward generalization to these analogs of tree comparisons.

The spherical 4(1)-tree comparison implies the strict version of the condition MTW+CTIL and therefore implies CTP.
