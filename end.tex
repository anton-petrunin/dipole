\section{Final remarks}

The following problem discussed in \cite[7.1]{AKP} was one of the original motivations to study the tree comparison.

\begin{thm}{Problem}
Which finite metric spaces admit isometric embeddings into some Alexandrov spaces with nonnegative curvature.
\end{thm}

The problem is still open.
According to \cite[4.1]{AKP}, the $(n-1)$-tree comparison provides a necessary condition for the problem $n$-point metric spaces.
This condition is sufficient for the 4-point metric spaces.
It might be still sufficient for 5-point metric spaces,
but not for 6-point metric spaces.

The corresponding example of 6-point metric space was constructed by Sergei Ivanov, see \cite{AKP}.
Theorem~\ref{2(2)+3(1)}, provides a source for such examples --- any 6-point metric space which satisfy all 5-tree comparisons, but does not satisfy 2(2)-tree comparison provide an example.
This class of examples includes the example of Sergei Ivanov --- in the notations of \cite[7.1]{AKP} it does not satisfies the comparison for the tree $y/az(q/xb)$.

By Theorem~\ref{2(2)+3(1)} and a theorem in \cite{AKP}, 
5-tree and 2(2)-tree comparisons provide a necessary condition for 6-point metric spaces.
We expect that these conditions are sufficient

   (2) edge node[above]{}(6);

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1,
  thick,main node/.style={circle,draw,font=\sffamily\bfseries,minimum size=3mm}]

  \node[main node] (1) at (0,0) {};
  \node[main node] (2) at (1/2,5/6){};
  \node[main node] (3) at (0,10/6){};
  \node[main node] (4) at (2,0) {};
  \node[main node] (5) at (3/2,5/6) {};
  \node[main node] (6) at (2,10/6) {};

  \path[every node/.style={font=\sffamily\small}]
   (1) edge node[above]{}(2)
   (2) edge node[above]{}(3)
   (2) edge node[above]{}(5)
   (4) edge node[above]{}(5)
   (5) edge node[above]{}(6);
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

Here an other candidate for a sufficient condition.

\begin{thm}{Question}
Assume $F$ is a finite metric space which satisfies all tree comparisons.
Is it true that $F$ is isometric to a subset of Alexandrov space with nonpositive curvature?
\end{thm}

Note that even for finite metric space the all tree comparison has to be checked for infinite set of trees since one point of the space may be used as a label for several vertexes in the tree.

There is a chance that for 5-point and 6-point metric spaces, this condition is also necessary. 
Since there are nonnegatively curved Riemannian manifolds which are not cost-convex, 
Theorem~\ref{T=>CTIL:CTIL} implies that this condition can not be necessary for 7-point metric spaces.

\medskip

For any metric space $X$ with an isometric group action $G\acts X$ with closed orbits the quotient map $X\to X/G$ is a submetry.
In particular, by Theorem~\ref{thm:hilbert-quotient}, if $G\acts \HH$ is an isometric action with closed orbits on the Hilbert space, then the quotient space $\HH/G$ satisfies all tree comparisons.

\begin{thm}{Question}
Assume $X$ is a metric space satisfying all tree comparisons.
Is it always possible to construct an isometric group action with closed orbits on the Hilbert space $G\acts \HH$ such that $X$ is isometric to a subset in $\HH/G$?
